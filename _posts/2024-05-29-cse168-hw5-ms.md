## Transmission

I have (almost) implemented microfacet transmission using the GGX distribution model[^1] with BSDF importance sampling. The relevant commands are `transmittance <r> <g> <b>` and `ior <x>`. The transmission seems to be working correctly with roughness, and refraction *kind of* works, as illustrated by the following demo image (modified from the test GGX scene file for Homework 4).

*GGX spheres and planes: The sphere on the left has `ior 1` and `roughness 0.25`, and seems to be working okay (at least it passes the test by casual eye). The plane in the middle has `ior 1.2` and `roughness 1`, but it's weirdly bright. Finally, the plane on the right has `ior 1` and `roughness 0.001`, and it seems fine.*

Unforunately, "*kind of* works" is doing some heavy-lifting here.

*GGX spheres and planes: Same as before, but all with `ior 1.5`. Evidently, not all is right. No clue what's going on with the sphere on the left.*

However, I would like to note that all of these effects were attempted *without* photon mapping. I initially wanted to experiment with extending previous techniques to transmission, just to see how feasible it would be. As such, the NEE is completely wrong, and even wholly transparent objects will cast shadows.

*GGX spheres and planes: Additional plane on the right with `specular 0 0 0`, `transmittance 1 1 1`, `roughness 0.001`, and `ior 1`. Spooky shadow...*

Turning off NEE and increasing the number of samples, we do get something "decent." The spooky shadows are gone, and the purple translucent plane now casts a purple shadow. So everything seems mostly correct. Refraction still seems mostly broken, though.

*GGX sphers and planes: Same as before, but with `nee off` and `spp 2048`.*

### ℹ️ Update: 5/31/2024

I got refraction working :) Again, without NEE.

*GGX spheres and planes: Yay! The ball on the left is supposed to replicate glass, with `ior 1.5`. It accurately flips the image behind it. Note that the refraction here doesn't make much sense. Planes are treated as faces of some larger object. So rays hitting the planes are treated as entering some object, but since there's no back face, they just... stay refracted. To model a thin piece of glass, we should place backwards facing planes behind each of the planes. But then the refraction effect would be almost unnoticeable, so that is not done here for the sake of demonstration.*

<!---

Unfortunately, I came to the sad realization that the Fresnel reflection term $$F_r$$ given in Homework 4 is not # adequate for transmission. $$F_r$$ is dependent on the index of refraction $$\eta$$. In Schlick's approximation[^2], $$F_r$$ # has a term $$R_0$$ that essentially represents the "specular color" (when looking head on, this is the reflected color), # and $$R_0$$ depends on $$\eta$$. But in Homework 4, we set $$R_0 \coloneqq k_s$$, the "specular color." So what's really # going on is we're implicitly setting $$\eta$$ to a large value, such that $$R_0 = k_s$$. This means our $$\eta$$ has been # directly tied to $$s$$ the whole time (without me realizing it). This is fine without transmission, since we don't care # about $$\eta$$ anyway. But $$\eta$$ does matter when implementing transmission. If we want $$k_s$$ to have color components, # then $$\eta$$ must as well. And if we want $$\eta$$ to not have color components, then $$k_s$$ must not as well (which... # would be terrible).

As for why $$F_r$$ sucks in the first place, it's because the Fresnel reflection doesn't kick in quickly enough before # hitting total internal reflection (TIR). Ideally, we'd want the reflection to slowly fade in while the transmission # slowly fades out. This is how TIR *should* behave. But since our $$F_r$$ isn't dependent on $$\eta$$, this doesn't happen # at all. Instead, we see jarring cutoffs where TIR is occurring.

*GGX spheres and planes: The plane in the center has `ior 1.5`. Observe the giant black cutoff. Worst of all, since # $$F_r$$ is too small, there's not even a reflection. It just appears black.*

So our $$F_r$$ sucks, and improving it seems to require a color dependent $$\eta$$. Hopefully I find an easy hack to model # $$F_r$$ without a color dependent $$\eta$$. Originally I wasn't planning on modeling color dependent refraction, but # dispersion is a pretty cool effect, so maybe I will. I'm not sure how feasible it is to model with just RGB, though. # PBRT uses spectral rendering[^3], but I wonder if that's too much work.

## Photon Mapping

Turning off NEE and relying on brute force is pretty impractical, so I imagine this is where photon mapping comes into play. I've only just started reading into it, though, so I'm still not totally sure. Hence I have nothing to show related to photon mapping right now.
