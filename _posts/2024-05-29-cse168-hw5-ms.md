## Transmission

I have (almost) implemented microfacet transmission using the GGX distribution model[^1] with BSDF importance sampling. The relevant commands are `transmittance <r> <g> <b>` and `ior <x>`. The transmission seems to be working correctly with roughness, and refraction *kind of* works, as illustrated by the following demo image (modified from the test GGX scene file for Homework 4).

*GGX spheres and planes: The sphere on the left has `ior 1` and `roughness 0.25`, and seems to be working okay (at least it passes the test by casual eye). The plane in the middle has `ior 1.2` and `roughness 1`, but it's weirdly bright. Finally, the plane on the right has `ior 1` and `roughness 0.001`, and it seems fine.*

Unforunately, "*kind of* works" is doing some heavy-lifting here.

*GGX spheres and planes: Same as before, but all with `ior 1.5`. Evidently, not all is right. No clue what's going on with the sphere on the left.*

However, I would like to note that all of these effects were attempted *without* photon mapping. I initially wanted to experiment with extending previous techniques to transmission, just to see how feasible it would be. As such, the NEE is completely wrong, and even wholly transparent objects will cast shadows.

*GGX spheres and planes: Additional plane on the right with `specular 0 0 0`, `transmittance 1 1 1`, `roughness 0.001`, and `ior 1`. Spooky shadow...*

Turning off NEE and increasing the number of samples, we do get something "decent." The spooky shadows are gone, and the purple translucent plane now casts a purple shadow. So everything seems mostly correct. Refraction still seems mostly broken, though.

*GGX sphers and planes: Same as before, but with `nee off` and `spp 2048`.*

## Photon Mapping

Turning off NEE and relying on brute force is pretty impractical, so I imagine this is where photon mapping comes into play. Also, I think I might not have to deal with all the Jacobian calculation confusion for photon mapping, since photon mapping starts from the light source. I've only just started reading into it, though, so I'm still not totally sure. Hence I have nothing to show related to photon mapping right now.
