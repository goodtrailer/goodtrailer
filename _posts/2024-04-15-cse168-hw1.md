## OptiX and Acceleration Structure

I implemented OptiX support, which massively reduced render times. Instead of using the provided OptiX 6.5 template, I set it up from scratch with a newer version (OptiX 8.0) and integrated it into my existing submission for CSE 167. However, the ray tracer still uses the CPU backend by default. To enable OptiX, the command `backend optix` must be included in the scene file. The default is `backend cpu`.

In my existing CPU implementation, I implemented a Bounding Volume Hierarchy along the lines of Pharr, Jakob, and Humphreys's description in *Physically Based Rendering 4e*, alongside an efficient intersection algorithm for axis-aligned bounding volumes given by Ericson's *Real-Time Collision Detection*. To disable the BVH, the command `accelerator naive` must be included in the scene file. The default is `accelerator bvh`.

A comparison of render times can be found below. The program was compiled with MSVC using `/O2` optimization and `/openmp` paralellization, and it was run on my laptop's Intel i7-12700H and NVIDIA RTX 3060.

*Scene render time comparisons between CPU without BVH, CPU with BVH, and GPU with OptiX. Note that scenes 8&ndash;10 are too complex to render without acceleration in a reasonable amount of time, so the times are left as N/A. [CSE 168 image-grader report.](https://raviucsdgroup.s3.amazonaws.com/homework1/6102a1a992205cdaa41cb91a62662014/20240415122630/index.html)*

Using the BVH and OptiX, I was able to render much more computationally taxing scenes (scenes 8&ndash;10), such as the one below of a reflective Stanford Dragon in a highly reflective box.

## Transmission
I added `transmittance` and `ior` (index of refraction) commands. The effect is decently realistic. For example, the following images demonstrate how a transparent sphere warps light at different refractive indices. Notably, a glass ball (`ior 1.5`) seems to turn the image upside down, which is physically accurate.

As an aside, I would like to note that while my submission in CSE 167 also included transmission, I have since improved upon it by handling total internal reflection. Interestingly, this *significantly* improved render times in certain cases. Normally, one ray becomes two rays: one reflected and one transmitted. But under total internal reflection, we only need the reflected ray. So one ray becomes one ray, which lessens the exponential explosion.

Just to experiment, I also rendered a few scenes of the Stanford dragon with varying refractive indices and transmittance.

*Scene 10, Stanford Dragon: `ior 1.015` `transmittance .37 .74 .47`, 3840x2160*

*Scene 10, Stanford Dragon: `ior 1.5` `transmittance .37 .74 .47`, 3840x2160*

*Scene 10, Stanford Dragon: `ior 1.5` `transmittance .95 .95 .95`, 3840x2160*

It's interesting how chaotic/noisy the final image is, as the refractive index is decently high and the model is quite complex/layered. There are also some dark spots near the tail caused by `maxdepth` being too low, but increasing `maxdepth` exponentially increases render times. The images above are already rendered with `maxdepth 9`.

## Anti-aliasing
I added a `sampler` command for scene files with two available options: `sampler basic` and `sampler rgss`. With `sampler rgss`, the program uses Rotated Grid Supersampling (RGSS), which involves shooting 4 rays per pixel in a rotated square, which (loosely) creates a rotated grid. The grid is not perfect, but that could be viewed as a positive. Perfect grids can lead to visual artifacts when certain patterns align with the grid.

All of the images above have been rendered with `sampler basic` (no anti-aliasing), so below is a comparison between `sampler basic` and `sampler rgss` using scene 5. The top half of the renders are excluded because they are simply black.

*Scene 5: `sampler basic` above, `sampler rgss` below, 640x480*

## Gamma Correction
I also added a `colorspace` command for scene files which allows input/output colors to be in either linear (default) or sRGB. The original assignment required *not* performing gamma correction. However, PNGs assume sRGB values, which leads to linear outputs looking harsh/wrong. But since the scenes used values based on those linear outputs, simply adding `colorspace output srgb` without tweaking the values  looked quite odd, as shown below. Note that scenes 8&ndash;10 were configured with `colorspace input srgb` and `colorspace output srgb`.
