Check out my [resume](/resume) for the professional stuff. This page is for yapping about my hobbies.
<br><br>
In my free time, I love gaming (mostly [*osu!*](https://osu.ppy.sh), [*Minecraft*](https://minecraft.net), and [*League of Legends*](https://leagueoflegends.com)), binging anime (check out MyAnimeList above; I recommend [*Run with the Wind*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37965), but [*Fairy Tail*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702) is my favorite), and watching basketball (GSW are making the finals this year, I can feel it). Hiking is great too, but it can be hard to find the time.
<br><br>
I'm also passionate about math. It started as a mild interest, but now it's somehow my #1 hobby (the CompSci degree may as well be a disguise...). My main interests are in analysis and geometry. It sounds super boring, but it's really fun. I promise.
<br><br>
Reading is interesting too, when I'm not busy. Some books I read recently are [*Killing Hope*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78130), [*The Information*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8701960), and [*The Left Hand of Darkness*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423).
