Check out my [resume](/resume) for the professional stuff. This page is just about my hobbies.
<br><br>
In my free time, I like playing video games (mostly [*osu!*](https://osu.ppy.sh), [*Minecraft*](https://minecraft.net), and [*LoL*](https://leagueoflegends.com)), binging anime (check out MyAnimeList above; I'd highly recommend [*Run with the Wind*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37965)), and watching the Warriors be incredibly mid. I like to hike sometimes and fold origami too, if that wasn't obvious from the photos on the home page.
<br><br>
I'm also really passionate about math, more as a hobby than anything else (while I am technically majoring in it, I highly doubt the possibility of having a career in it, though that would be cool!). My main interests are in analysis: functional analysis, harmonic analysis, fine properties, etc. I've been trying to pick up a bit of geometry and complex analysis, but I haven't found much time recently. Alas, perhaps once I'm out of school, I'll finally have the time! And while I'm daydreaming, maybe one day I'll finally learn algebra properly... just kidding, that's never happening.

Some books I read "recently" (okay frankly it's been a while) are [*Killing Hope*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78130), [*The Information*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8701960), and [*The Left Hand of Darkness*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423).
